 <h1>The best movies for Joy</h1>
 <h2>My Top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Arcane</h3>
 <p>This is my number one on the list because the sonds used in the scenes were intentional. i loved the concept and emotions put into it. i loved the fighting scenes too. It is the best anime i have seen so far.</p>
 <h3>Mary</h3>
 <p>It gave a different angle about the birth of Jesus. Instead of focusing on Jesus ,It focused on mary and her role in the birth of jesus christ. i loved it</p>
 <h3>Bad boys for life</h3>
 <p>i loved the comedy and action. </p>
